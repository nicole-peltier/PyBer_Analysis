# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to find the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver for each type of city. The other purpose was to create a multiple line chart using the sum of fares for dates between January and April of 2019 for each type of city. 

## Results

### Summary DataFrame

As the chart shows above, rural cities have the lowest number of total rides and the lowest total fares but the highest average fare per ride. The urban cities have the highest number of total rides and the highest total fares but the lowest average fare per ride. 

### PyBer Fare Summary

Looking at the multiple line chart, the rural cities have the lowest total fares per week between January and April. The urban cities have the highest total fares per week between January and April. The highest week for total fares between all three types of cities is at the end of February.  


## Summary
One recommendation that can be made after this analysis is to encourage more rural rides since it has the lowest number of total rides and the lowest total fares. The other recommendation would be to encourage more drivers to drive to rural areas so that rides increase and the total fares increase. A third recommendation would be to do a further analysis as to why there is an increasse in rides at the end of February and what can be done to continue those rides throughout the other months.
